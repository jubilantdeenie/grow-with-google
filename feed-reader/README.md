## Project Overview

This project is part of Udacity's "Exploring JS- Objects, Tools and Testing" coursework for the Front End Developer Nanodegree. 

It is made using Jasmine to create test-driven code in JavaScript. Starter materials have been provided by Udacity. 

Tests are performed in feedreader.js to complete the assignment.   


### Feed Reader Quick Start

This project may be cloned or downloaded from the git repository. 

Open index.html in your browser to start the app. 

Tests are written in feedreader.js, located in the Jasmine spec folder. Find tests displayed at the bottom of the html page when viewed in the browser.

Passing tests are shown in green. A failing test will display in red.
