# Project Overview

This project is part of Udacity's "Exploring JS- Objects, Tools and Testing" coursework for the Front End Developer Nanodegree. It is made using Jasmine to create test-driven code in JavaScript. Starter materials have been provided by Udacity. The feedreader.js file has been modified to execute the assignment. 


## Original overview description from Udacity:

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
